# 100DaysOfCode Log

### Day 0: November 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Planning and researching Redux.

**Thoughts:** Redux has still been a mystery to me and has seemed like a bit of magic when using it. I am contemplating on a few different projects to choose from for 100 days of code challenge, which will be chosen soon.

**Link to work:** TBD

## Day 1: November 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More Redux

**Thoughts:** Redux is coming together the more I use it.

**Link to work** TBD

## Day 2: November 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Even More Redux

**Thoughts:** Building and burning an old project has helped me to solidify basics around actions, action creators, and reducers and how they are mapped to state with connect.

**Link to work** TBD

## Day 3: November 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Starting the Express Server for Summit Colorado

**Thoughts:** Haven't worked on the backend in awhile. It's nice to revisit something familiar again and have 'ah-ha' moments more often.

**Link to work** TBD

## Day 4: November 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Diving into Passport

**Thoughts:** Passport seems pretty straight forward but there are definitely things that I couldn't find in the docs that I had to find on my own.

**Link to work** TBD

## Day 5: November 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Passport Auth Flow / Heroku Deployment

**Thoughts:** Redux is coming together the more I use it.
